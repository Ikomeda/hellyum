# Hellyum

## Description

We wanted to create an application that would allow you to store recipes for weekly meal planning. In future development we would like to add a calender that would allow you to plan your meals and also give you a grocery list for the week!
We were able to create a page that stores recipes and allows you to create a recipe. 
Technologies used:
Handlebars, JavaScript, Bulma, MySql, Sequelize, Eslint, Prettier, Bcrypt, Express, Node.js cloudinary,
